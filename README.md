# HVCP
Hyper-V Console Plus

Hyper-V console rewritten in Powershell to add all the features i've allways wanted :)

![HVCP Gui](https://github.com/psott/HVCP/blob/master/assets/HVCP.png)

ToDo's:
- be able to connect to multiple servers
- add "create new VM" function
- be able to change VM settings
- save and restore last state
- add more features to context menu
- build a smaler version, like a widget
- add win10 notifications (do we need that?)

Please let me know if you have more ideas for the project
