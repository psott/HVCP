# HVCP
Hyper-V Console Plus

Hyper-V console rewritten in Powershell to add all the features we've allways wanted :)

![VM settings](https://github.com/psott/HVCP/blob/master/assets/VMSettings.png)

What does HVCP better then the original Hyper-V Console?
- delete VMs with all dedicated files with one click
- enable nested virtualisation via GUI
- give snapshots names
- more to come ...

ToDo's:
- be able to connect to multiple servers
- add "create new VM" function
- be able to change VM settings
- save and restore last state
- add more features to context menu
- build a smaler version, like a widget
- add win10 notifications (do we need that?)

Please let me know if you have more ideas for the project
